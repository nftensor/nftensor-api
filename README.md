# nftensor-api

API to manage querying Bittensor given prompts stored on the NFTensor smart contract.

This is currently using the Bittensor prompting network. Queries made are stored on the Ethereum blockchain.  
This python code fetches these queries, prompts bittensor, generates the NFT image with the response, uploads and pins the data to ipfs, 
and generates the NFT JSON metadata.
